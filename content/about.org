* Hello, I'm Cole! 👋

I'm currently enrolled at Rochester Institute of Technology 🐯 working towards a Bachelor's in Computer Science 🖥️.

I love hard problems and solving them even more.

I'm passionate about low-level programming in languages like **C** and **Rust**.

I've gotten very good at building full-stack applications with a variety of languages, frameworks, and databases.

In my spare time I like to lift heavy things 🏋️‍♂️ and read math books 📚.
